CMPM 121 - Game Technologies
Homework 2 - Lighting and Particle Systems


This project is an expansion upon my Homework 1 Assignment for CMPM 121 - Game Technologies.
This expanded upon Unity project includes my previously created scene, with placed 3D objects,
corresponding materials, as well as several different cameras that can be switched between
using the on screen UI. This further improved upon and polished Unity scene also includes 
different types of Lighting, an on screen UI to switch on and off certain lights, as well 
as a particle system.

Here's a link to the original GitHub page for this project,
specifically the one used for Homework 1, which includes a more through
list of where I obtained each of my assets, materials, and some code:
